Adalab Assignment - Module 2: Data Analysis Project with Sakila Database.

This project uses the Sakila database, a sample database that simulates a film rental store. 

Project Overview:

Working with various tables from the Sakila database to answer business questions and perform analysis on topics such as:

- Information about films and their categories.
- Actors and their relationship with films.
- Store customers and their rental activities.
- Rental details, including dates and costs.

Goal:

This project's goal is to familiarise ourselves with complex SQL queries, using the Sakila database to solve various scenarios that may arise in a film rental business. This analysis will help us extract valuable insights, optimise queries, and practice advanced SQL techniques.

File Structure:
